Back to the grind again this morning :disappointed:. Feeling a little tired after the weekend, but basically fine. I also managed to get back into my Chinese listening challenge this morning. I felt a little guilty about ignoring it all weekend, but actually I think it has helped :smiley:. I got straight into it this morning whilst sorting out my breakfast, listening to the next level of Assimil. I'm really enjoying this course so I think I will continue in the same vein at the end of the Extensive Listening Challenge.

I got into work with very little motivation, but that quickly picked up after I received a phone call from Lee Woodford confirming that we win the tender for the Boundary Wall Scheme in Senghenydd :smiley:.

The rest of the day was fairly uneventful offer than the fact the clear out of the big office started in earnest. I did: 

 * some more work on my personal notes site;
 * looked into the South Wales Fire & Rescue Service tender and tried to split the tender document down;
 * reviewed the boundary wall scheme quote and spoke to Ian Miles about doing the works; 
 * and to be honest, not a whole lot else. 

I left work at a sensible time for a bit of a chilled out evening with Rose and we watched Fast Five before bed.
