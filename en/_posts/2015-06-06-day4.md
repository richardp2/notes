The old HSK 1 deck is tough because there are a lot of characters I do not remember, but my
accuracy level is still fairly high and I think I have now reviewed all of them so it should just be
a case of relearning the odd few here and there and keeping up with the reviews.

I have been intending to get back into studying my Assimil course, but so far I have been too
lazy/tired in the morning so I haven't got out of bed in time to do this. Mark is now here for the
weekend too, so I don't think things will progress in the way that I hoped.
