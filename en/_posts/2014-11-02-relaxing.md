This morning started more sedately that yesterday, I sent George to his room to read his book at
about 0645, then rolled over and went back to sleep because it was my turn for a lie in again
:smile:. I woke up of myown accord at about 0915 and decided that I really didn't feel like going
for a run this morning. Instead we sat down to watch Saturday Kitchen best bites with bacon and egg
rolls for breakfast :+1:. 

The weather this morning was pretty crappy, and George was quite tired so we decided to drop off
some more things Rosie sold to try to get George to have a bit of a sleep. Success! He fell asleep
on the way route home so, whilst he was sleeping, I had a long overdue hair cut and a shower. The
rest of the day continued at a fairly sedate pace, we had lunch, played sword fights with George &
generally relaxed until it stopped raining. Then I took the other 20 bags of slate up to Granny's
before dinner. 

This evening I was able to go back to Freerunning :laughing:. Although I was already knackered from
the rest of the weekend, I was able to go all out and have a great evening again. I did some work on
my basic flips this evening, finally landing a proper sideflip :smile:, landing a standing frontflip
and almost landing a roundoff backflip.

By the time I got home, I was absolutely knackered. I think I will suffer a bit in the morning.
