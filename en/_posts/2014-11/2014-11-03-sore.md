Damn I'm sore today! Walking down stairs is especially painful! I think I may have slightly overdone
it last night. After all the heavy lifting in the garden, the heavy jumping session has effectively
destroyed my thighs! But, at least in theory, that should really help my leg strength :weary:.

I almost left for work on time this morning, but with all the faffing around, I failed again. Maybe
tomorrow. I did a load of quoting works today to try to actually get caught up with everything. I
managed to get all the main work items priced up for the Abertillery Library tender, I finalised the
Ty Wern Court External Cladding works quote and chased up Remmers about the waterproofing system for
the Library. That doesn't really sound like a lot, but I thought I was working quite well today 
:disappointed:.

This evening was nice though, another chilled out evening watching Numb3rs, and not a lot else
:smile:.
