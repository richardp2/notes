Today was the day the veg bed died! After being told off by George for wanting to go for a run (I
didn't go in the end because he was really upset) we decided to make a start on some of the garden
works. Rosie planned to get the veg bed down and her car cleaned over the course of the weekend.
Once I had found a sledgehammer in Dad's many garages, I set to work and within half an hour it was
no more! The veg bed was officially dead. Not a lot else to say about that really.

This evening, Si and Andrea came rounf for an Indian and a catch up. It was brilliant, really nice
to catch up with them because it seems to be longer and longer between catch ups since we left 
Scouting. Si also brought round a new challenge for me :smile:. A dead laptop hard drive that needs
some data recovering. I will have to see how that goes tomorrow. I set it going when they arrived
and we hadn't really got anywhere by bedtime so I will change tact and try something else tomorrow.
