I have realised that my journal entries thus far have been very task oriented and lacking in the
main elements of a journal. People usually write journals to express their thoughts and feelings and
I simply haven't been, so from now on that is going to change.

Today was just another day for me, I was quite proud of the fact that I managed to get out of bed on
the first snooze alarm. I think that is a huge improvement :smile:, I just need to do better
tomorrow. 

Work was fairly lighthearted, and other than dad irritating me a little I felt good. I managed to
get a load of work done, although the scaffolder has yet to produce a quote for the Church. Why are
all these subcontractors such hard work! I asked him last Friday and he assured me I would have a
quote by Monday, Tuesady at the latest. It's now Thursday :angry:!

I was at least able to releash some of my frustrations this evening by going running :smile:. Speed
work again this evening. I felt a lot better today than Tuesday when we set out from the Uni, and I
think I'm getting faster :smile:. I was consistently in the top 2 or 3 to finish each sprint and a
number of times I was at the front. I really am enjoying running with CRC and I'm enjoying the
rivalry that running with a club brings. I think it is making a huge difference to my running in
general so I can't complain.
