Today promised to be difficult right from the get go. The greenhouse has been a pain in the neck
ever since we said we would give it to Jan & Graham. There has been problem after problem with when
they want it, how they want it and when would be good for us to install it etc. The saga continued
today. Rosie agreed that we would get down to Taunton by lunchtime, but at 1000 we had a phone call
from Graham asking where we were and then berating us for not being there because we would never get
the greenhouse done in time. That put both of us in a foul mood prior to leaving, but we tried to
stay calm with each other and George (who was getting increasingly tired anyway). 

On the drive down, Rosie & I decided that we didn't want either of them involved and that they could
just take George to the park for the day to keep out the way. As usual, things did not work out like
that. Everybody seemed fairly calm when we got there so we asked where they wanted it, and after
some discussion, no decision was reached :persevere: and Graham could stop telling George off for
playing with things that he had left out! Not George's fault! In the end, Jan took George to feed
the ducks and left Graham with us because she didn't feel George deserved to be constantly told off
for being a toddler. We both thought this would now be hard work, but we were proved wrong 
:relieved:. Graham generally stayed out the way and tried to help where he could. In the end, Jan
made exactly the right decision! There were no more arguments, George had a great day with Nana and
the greenhouse was completed before it got dark. Perfect!

I think having the greenhouse done really helped with Graham's mood because he seemed to be more 
himself for the rest of the evening and we actually had a pleasant evening with them before retiring
to our room and bed.
