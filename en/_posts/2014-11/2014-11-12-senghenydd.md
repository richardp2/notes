Ok so this getting up malarky is getting a bit ridiculous now! At least I have George to keep me on
the straight and narrow :smiley:. I was then a bit stressed out because as far as I could tell, we
had no food for breakfast and I only had half a lunch. I snapped at George more than I would have
liked. He didn't deserve it :disappointed:! Rosie got up and helped to sort out some food for the
day and I settled down a bit before leaving for work.

I spent the day trying my best to work to my prescribed schedule today. This identified some changes
that I needed to make. I decided to focus on three key tasks throughout the day, if there is any
time left, then I can do other little things. I looked at the Boundary Wall Scheme in Senghenydd
mainly today, carrying out some basic QS tasks without really thinking much about it. After planning
out what to do for the day, I put together a breakdown of the costs for the project and then 
realised that I had put together a very basic QF0! It seems that old habits do die hard! It's been a
while since I've dealt with cost value reconcilliation and cost forecasting so it was novel to be
looking at it again. Let's hope the future involves more controlled QS works :smile:.

The evening was another nice relaxed one, but I did manage to get some Chinese reading done, which
was good. Now to bed I think.
