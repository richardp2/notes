Today, we went down to Taunton for Graham's Birthday. The day began with the greenhouse getting
loaded into the car. We previously collapsed it as much as we thought we would need, but once I
started loaded it into the car, it became apparent that the larger pieces needed to be broken down
even further. We also failed to get the door into the car, but we can take that down next weekend
when we come back to install the greenhouse. Once we had unloaded the greenhouse into the back
garden, we had to change into clean clothes to go out for a carvery lunch at the Blackbrook Tavern.

It was really good, or at least I enjoyed it. You could have your choice of up to two meats and as
much veg as you like. That is always a good thing in my book :smiley:. It was a lovely lunch
followed by too much dessert (as usual) before we headed back to the outlaws for cake.

The afternoon was mostly spent in a food induced coma with George running around the place like a
loon. We indulged in cake an hour or so after we got back and didn't bother with dinner before we
left at 1900, we were just too full still. George passed out in the car as we were getting on the
motorway and when we got home we just put him straight to bed and collapsed on the sofa.
