So I had a breakdown this evening and I cannot understand why! We have had an absolutely wonderful
day, George has been brilliant, we've spent time with friends, we've eaten good food and we've
relaxed so where the breakdown came from, I have no idea! Thankfully Rosie was on hand to sort me
out, even if she shouldn't have to :unamused:. She really is something special :heart_eyes:.

Anyway, today was the day of the **free** photoshoot with Jenny Healey Photography. We were all
looking forward to it because Jenny has been great with George every time we have dealt with her,
even when it had nothing to do with photographs. And this time, she did not disappoint. She really
managed to engage George and got some beautiful shots of all of us that we love. When we went back
in the afternoon to choose our pictures, we ended up choosing to have a disc with all the photos on
because we could not decide! Given the prices she charges, we didn't actually have to think about it
for that long either. She is a very good and very affordable photographer who we will be going back
to again and again I think!

The rest of the day, including the time between the shoot and the review, was fairly chilled out. We
had a Festive Bake and a Costa's (although the praline cappuccino is nothing to write home about)
and played for a bit at home before M&C had to go home. George got very upset saying "Don't want
them to go!", poor lad. He really does like them!

We then had a good evening watching Sherlock (I am now going to have to download series 3 after that
horrific cliffhanger!) and doing a little bit of Chinese Reading before my meltdown just before
going to bed :disappointed:.
