Monday morning brings another excessive lie in, so Assimil took another back step. The intention was
to do some of it in work when I had a few minutes spare, but things went horribly wrong with the
network this morning so it hasn't been brilliant. I will keep trying and will definitely get the
momentum back up soon. I will have to organise a lesson on iTalki to focus my mind I think.
