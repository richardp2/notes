This morning started with another early wake up from George and another reluctant response from me.
This is becoming a habit! Nevermind. Even though I finished my paleo challenge yesterday, I still
decided to have mainly paleo for breakfast and lunch. So I had omelette and veg for breakfast and
salad for lunch, although I did add cheese to both considering how much I missed it! 

There was no Julie this morning so dad made the morning round of tea and he didn't mess up my green
tea! I was pleasantly surprised. This morning I worked on the quote for BGCBC, and the one for Ty
Wern Court before chowing down on my first bacon and sausage sandwich since September, it was
fantastic!! The rest of the day was fairly non-descript, but at least I concentrated on my actual
job a lot more today! 

I left the office just after 1530, because it's Friday, and I was looking forward to a very non
paleo evening. Just after I got home, we walked down to the chip shop, having put some breaded fish
in the oven, to pick up the largest constituent of our meal. Again, it was brilliant and I followed
it up with the cake Julie gave me during the week. 

Once George was in bed, Rosie and I (well mainly Rosie) sorted though the pictures of the things to
sell on Facebook and priced them up. A couple of things sold really quickly with pick ups planned
for the weekend. Bonus! Once that was sorted, I wrote up a blog post about my paleo challenge and
published it whilst we watched Numb3rs. Realistically it was quite a good day. I even managed to
complete the [Hacking Chinese][hc] [Extensive Listening Challenge][elc] completing just over 20hrs
of listening in the last 3 weeks :smiley:. I do think it has helped my Mandarin. I think I will
write a blog post about that too :wink:.
